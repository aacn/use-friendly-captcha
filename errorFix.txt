1. Error: Can't find module
- Fix: use yarn link to add your library as local dependency to your CRA (your app)

2. Error: Webpack < 5 Polyfill errors all over the place
- Fix: Add rollup plugin that adds those functions again (rollup-plugin-node-polyfills)

3. Error: React hooks are not working
- Fix: when testing librarys local, the dependency for 'react' & 'react-dom' need to be removed
from the library dependency, otherwise there will be several instances of reacts, thus leading to errors.
So in your lib you only have react & react-dom in your peerDeps and then you go into your CRA
from there you do:
'cd node_modules/react', 'yarn link'
'cd node_moudles/react-dom', 'yarn link'

now you go back to your lib and there you can now link to those modules from your CRA
'yarn link react'
'yarn link react-dom'

This will resolve the error, that when trying to run a test, it says 'cant find module 'react', since its
obviously not inside your package.json as dep or devDep.
